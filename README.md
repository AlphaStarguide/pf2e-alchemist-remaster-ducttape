> [!IMPORTANT]
> PF2e system has been updated with the Player Core 2 Alchemist features. This module still functions and provides added functionality and quality of life features aimed to streamline playing Alchemist.

A quality of life module to automate features for the Alchmist remaster from Player Core 2.

## Known issues

- If multiple players are owner of an actor they will also get prompted to add vials and learn formulas.

## Features

For a list of features and settings please view [the Wiki](https://github.com/thejoester/pf2e-alchemist-remaster-ducttape/wiki)

## Requests

This is still sort of a work in progress, and by no means a full release. I have made changes that affect my players the most at the moment. I expect when the Alchemist Player Core 2 changes are implemented in the PF2e system, parts of this module will be obsolete. 

In the meantime if you have a request for a work around fix for an Alchemist feature, please submit one in the [Issues Page](https://github.com/thejoester/pf2e-alchemist-remaster-ducttape/issues).

Then download the [en.json](https://github.com/thejoester/pf2e-alchemist-remaster-ducttape/blob/master/lang/en.json) file, rename it to the language code or language (for example es.json or spanish.json for Spanish language), then edit the file translating the text in quotes on the RIGHT SIDE of the colon.
