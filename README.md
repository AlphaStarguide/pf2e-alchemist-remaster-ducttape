# PF2e Alchemist Remaster Duct Tape

> [!IMPORTANT]
> PF2e system 6.8.0 has been released with the Player Core 2 Alchemist features. So far in my testing nothing in this module causes any issues with the new alchemist features and still seems to work. I will continue updating my module and keep the Quick Alchemy Macro as some may still find it useful, or for those who are not updating the p2Fe system yet. 

A module to slap together some functionality until the PF2e system is updated to support the Alchmist remaster.

## Known issues

- The first time you use the Quick Alchemy macro (`qaCraftAttack();`) it will take a minute to load the screen.
- If multiple players are owner of an actor they will also get prompted to add vials and learn formulas.

## Features

For a list of features and settings please view [the Wiki](https://github.com/thejoester/pf2e-alchemist-remaster-ducttape/wiki)


## Requests

This is still sort of a work in progress, and by no means a full release. I have made changes that affect my players the most at the moment. I expect when the Alchemist Player Core 2 changes are implemented in the PF2e system, parts of this module will be obsolete. 

In the meantime if you have a request for a work around fix for an Alchemist feature, please submit one in the [Issues Page](https://github.com/thejoester/pf2e-alchemist-remaster-ducttape/issues).
