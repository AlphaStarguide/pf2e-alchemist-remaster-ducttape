# PF2e Alchemist Remaster Duct Tape

A module to slap together some functionality until the PF2e system is updated to support the Alchmist remaster.

## Known issues

- The first time you use the Quick Alchemy macro (qaCraftAttack();) it will take a minute to load the screen.


## Features

**Quick Alchemy:** funcion that will consume 1 Versatile Vile, and craft an item from your formulas. A dialog box will appear with two drop downs. The first will list formulas for items of type weapon (bombs), and will have a "Craft and Attack" button which will craft the item then open the dialog box for the attack actions. You must have a target selected first. The second dropdown will list consumable items that you have the formula for and have a "Craft" button. All items created with this will have the "Infused" trait. 
A macro will be included in the compendium.
